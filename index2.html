            <h1>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means
                the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football 
                (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football 
                (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as 
                football codes.</h1>

                    Player of the Year awards (1996–97 and 2002) from the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Ronaldo was transferred in 
                    1994 from Cruzeiro to PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands, where he scored 55 goals in 56 games and won the 1995 league championship and the 
                    1996 Dutch Cup. After switching to FC Barcelona of Spain for the 1996–97 season, he scored 34 goals in 37 appearances and helped his team 
                    capture the Spanish Super Cup. Because of his success, Ronaldo was paid $27 million by Inter Milan to play for the Italian club in 1997, a 
                    record at the time. At Inter his excellent dribbling skills and knack for scoring goals earned him the nickname “Il Fenomeno.” In 1997 Ronaldo
                    became the first player to win FIFA’s Player of the Year award two years in a row. In 1999, however, he suffered a serious knee injury that left
                     him unable to play for almost two years.</h3>

                    while pursuing a personal life rife with drug and alcohol abuse and health problems, died on Wednesday in Tigre, Argentina, in Buenos Aires 
                    Province. He was 60. At Maradona’s feet, the ball seemed to obey his command like a pet. (He was said to do with an orange what others could only 
                    do with a ball.) And he played with a kind of brilliant camouflage, seeming to be somnolent for long stretches before asserting himself at urgent 
                    moments with a mesmerizing dribble, astounding pass or stabbing shot.“Brazen and shameless, Maradona was all mock innocence, talking about the 
                    ‘hand of God,’” Brian Glanville wrote in his book “The History of the World Cup.” “For England, rather, it was the hand of the devil.”
                     Four minutes later, Maradona scored again, eventually giving Argentina a 2-1 victory. </h3>

                    the championship. He set a franchise record for goals scored in 2008, before Real Madrid paid a record $131 million for his services the following 
                    year. Among his many accomplishments, he has won a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards for player of the year, and led Portugal to an emotional

                <h3>Ibrahimovic made his professional debut for Malmö FF in 1999, and helped the second-division club make the leap to the first level the following
                    season. The 6'5" striker then signed with the prominent Dutch club AFC Ajax and honed his formidable skills as part of two title-winning teams,
                    though he also developed a reputation as a temperamental player. fter four years with Ajax, Ibrahimovic transferred to Juventus F.C. and led the
                     Italian club to two Serie A championships. However, Juventus was stripped of those titles when club management was charged with fixing matches 
                    in the infamous Calciopoli scandal, and Ibrahimovic forced a transfer to A.C. Milan. More success followed for the towering striker, who won three
                    straight Serie A titles and claimed his first league scoring crown in 2009.Traded to F.C. Barcelona for Samuel Eto'o in 2009, Ibrahimovic starred
                    for a loaded club that rolled to a league title and Super Cup victories, but he butted heads with manager Pep Guardiola and spent the following
                     season on loan to A.C. Milan. The Italian club purchased his contract outright for 2011-12 and Ibrahimovic claimed his second scoring crown,
                    although his amazing streak of eight straight seasons on a title-winning club came to an end. After transferring to Paris Saint-Germain
                    in 2012, the veteran striker proved he had plenty left in the tank by claiming a third scoring title with a career-high 30 goals, and 
                    leading the club to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years.</h3>
