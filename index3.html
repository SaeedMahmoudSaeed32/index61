                <h3>Michael Jordan is a former professional American basketball player, Olympic athlete, businessperson and actor. Considered one of the best
                    basketball players ever, he dominated the sport from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six National Basketball
                    Association championships and earned the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award five times. With five regular-season MVPs and three All-Star MVPs,
                     Jordan became the most decorated player in the NBA. Jordan enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981 and soon
                     became an important member of the school's basketball team. UNC won the NCAA Division I championship in 1982, with Jordan scoring the
                     inal basket needed to defeat Georgetown University. He was also singled out as the NCAA College Player of the Year in 1983 and in 1984.
                      Jordan left college after his junior year to join the NBA in 1984. In 1985, Jordan finished his bachelor's degree in geography as he
                     continued to play basketball professionally. Jordan began his professional basketball career when he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls
                     in 1984. He was the third overall pick, behind Hakeem Olajuwon, who was selected first by the Houston Rockets, and Sam Bowie, taken
                     by the Portland Trail Blazers; the draft also featured legendary players John Stockton and Charles Barkley.</h3>

                     in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was
                     a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive 
                     Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. 
                    In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and Julius Erving have
                    called him the greatest basketball player of all time. After winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City,
                    Alcindor was recruited by Jerry Norman, the assistant coach of UCLA, where he played for coach John Wooden[7] on three consecutive national
                    championship teams and was a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks
                     franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 
                    in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark "skyhook" shot, he established himself as one of the league's top

                    of all time. Growing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball phenom. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play for coach Bobby
                    Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick to attend a local community college. The next year
                    he attended the smaller Indiana State University, playing ultimately for three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with
                    the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft, after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and play one more
                    season. It was a fortuitous decision: He led them to an undefeated regular season in 1978-1979, including a memorable national championship
                    game matchup against Michigan State, a team that featured Magic Johnson, beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for more than
                    a decade. Bird entered the NBA for the 1979-1980 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading
                    the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the Conference Finals.
