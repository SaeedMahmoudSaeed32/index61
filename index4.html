            <h1>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
                Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's
                court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable
                to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at
                all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham,
                England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well
                as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis,
                not lawn tennis.</h1>

                    Between 1974 and 1981, he became the first man in the Open Era to win 11 Grand Slam singles titles (six at the French Open and five consecutively
                    at Wimbledon), but he never won the US Open despite four finals appearances. He is the first male player to win five Wimbledon titles in the Open
                    Era. Borg won four consecutive French Open titles (1978–81) and is 6–0 in French Open finals, the fourth-best record at a Grand Slam behind Pete
                    Sampras (7-0 at Wimbledon finals), Novak Djokovic (9-0 at Australian Open finals) and Rafael Nadal (13-0 at French Open finals). He is one of
                    two male players, along with Roger Federer, to appear in French Open and Wimbledon finals for four consecutive years (1978–81) and the only
                    man to win both of them in three consecutive years (1978–80).</h3>

                <h1>Rod Laver:</h1>
                <h3>Rodney George Laver AC MBE (born 9 August 1938) is an Australian former tennis player. He is widely regarded by many pundits, players and fans to
                    be one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Laver was ranked world No. 1 in nine different years, which is an all-time record in tennis.
                    He was the No. 1 ranked professional from 1964 to 1970, spanning four years before and three years after the start of the Open Era in 1968. He
                    also was the No. 1 ranked amateur in 1961–62.[3] He is the second and last male player to win each grand slam twice after Roy Emerson.
                    Laver's 200 singles titles are the most in tennis history. This included his all-time men's record of 10 or more titles per year for seven
                    consecutive years (1964–70). He excelled on all of the court surfaces of his time: grass, clay, hard, carpet, and wood/parquet.</h3>

                <h1>Roy Emerson:</h1>
                <h3>Roy Stanley Emerson AC (born 3 November 1936) is an Australian former tennis player who won 12 Grand Slam singles titles and 16 Grand Slam doubles
                    titles, for a total of 28 Grand Slam tournament titles. He is the only male player to have completed a career Grand Slam (winning titles at all
                    four Grand Slam events) in both singles and doubles, and the first of two men (the other being Rod Laver) to have completed a double career Grand
                    Slam in singles. His 28 major titles are the all-time record for a male player. In 1964, 1965, and 1967 he was ranked world No. 1. Emerson was
                    the first male player to win 12 majors. He held that record for 30 years until it was passed by Pete Sampras in 2000 and later by Federer,
                    Nadal and Djokovic. He also held the record of six Australian Open men's singles titles until 2019 when Novak Djokovic won his seventh title.
                    Emerson won five of them consecutively (1963–67), a record still unbroken to this day. Emerson is one of only five tennis players all-time 
                    to win multiple slam sets in two disciplines, only matched by Frank Sedgman, Margaret Court, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams.</h3>

                    tennis player. He is ranked world No. 3 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), has been ranked No. 1 in the ATP rankings for 209 weeks,
                    and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles, an all-time record shared with Roger Federer,
                    and 36 Masters 1000 men's singles titles, an all-time record shared with Novak Djokovic. His 13 French Open titles in particular are a record
                    at any tournament. Nadal's dominance on clay is also highlighted by 62 of his 88 ATP singles titles coming on the surface, including 26 of his
                    36 ATP Masters titles, and his 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era. From childhood through most
                    of his professional career, Nadal was coached by his uncle Toni. He was one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching No.
                    2 in the world at age 19 and winning 16 titles, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became No. 1 for the first time
                    in 2008 after his first major victory off clay against the longtime top-ranked Federer, his main rival through 2010, in a historic Wimbledon
                    final. He also won an Olympic gold medal in singles that year in Beijing, and then completed the career Grand Slam at the 2010 US Open in
                    the only year where he won three majors. With his Olympic gold medal, he is also one of only two male players to complete the career Golden

                    began in 1988 and ended at the 2002 US Open, which he won, defeating longtime rival Andre Agassi in the final; he is the only man in the Open Era
                    to have won the final Grand Slam tournament at which he competed. Sampras won 14 Grand Slam singles titles during his career, which was an Open
                    Era record at the time of his retirement: seven Wimbledon, two Australian Opens and a joint Open Era record five US Open titles. He won 64 singles
                    titles in total. He first reached world No. 1 in 1993, and held that position for a total of 286 weeks (third all time), including an Open Era 
                    record of six consecutive year-end No. 1 rankings from 1993 to 1998. A right-handed player with a single-handed backhand, his precise and powerful
                    serve earned him the nickname "Pistol Pete". In 2007, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.</h3>

                    Federer has played in an era where he dominated men's tennis together with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who have been collectively referred
                    to as the Big Three and are widely considered three of the greatest male tennis players of all-time.[c] A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998, 
                    Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. In 2004, he established himself as the best player in men's

                    made 18 out of 19 major singles finals. During this span, he won his fifth consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed
                    the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three previous runner-ups to Nadal, his main rival up until 2010. At age 27, he also

                     1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. He is currently ranked as world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Djokovic
                      has been No. 1 for a record total of 324 weeks, and has finished as year-end No. 1 on six occasions, an Open Era record shared with Pete Sampras.
                    Djokovic has won 18 Grand Slam men's singles titles and 83 ATP singles titles overall, including a record nine Australian Open titles and a joint
                     record 36 Masters events (shared with Rafael Nadal). He is the only player to win all of the "Big Titles" on the modern ATP Tour – that is, all 
                     four Grand Slam tournaments, all nine ATP Masters events, and the ATP Finals.[7][8] In particular, he is also the only player to complete the 
                     career Golden Masters, which he has done twice. Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. At age 20, he interrupted Roger Federer's and 
                     Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors to win his first Grand Slam singles title at the 2008 Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic also 
                     separated himself from the rest of men's tennis to join Federer and Nadal in the Big Three, the group of three players who have dominated men's
                      tennis for more than a decade.[a] In 2011, Djokovic was ranked No. 1 for the first time, winning three out of four majors and a then-season 
                      record of five Masters events. He remained the best player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade, leading the tour in major and Masters 
                      titles, and winning four out of his five titles at the ATP Finals consecutively from 2012 through 2015. After four consecutive year-end finishes
                       at No. 3 through 2010, Djokovic finished No. 1 for six years and No. 2 for three years in the next decade.</h3>
